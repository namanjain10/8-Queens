This repository contains the solution to the 8 queen problem.
The 8 queens problem is a very famous problem to obtain positions of 8 queens on the 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
I have written the Code to solve the problem in Python 3 and have solved the problem using backtracking.

To run the code run the file named "queen.py" and all the functions used in the code are in file "functions_queen.py".
